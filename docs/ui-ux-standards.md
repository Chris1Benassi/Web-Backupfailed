# Prose Class Overrides (from globals.css)

> The `.prose` class is used to style content generated by the Tailwind Typography plugin, which is designed for rich text content like blog posts, articles, and knowledge base (KB) entries. These overrides were created to address specific issues encountered when integrating the `.prose` class into the project.

**Where `.prose` is Referenced:**
- Currently, the `.prose` class is applied in `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` to style blog posts and KB articles.

**Issues Encountered:**
1. **Default Typography Styles**: The default `.prose` styles provided by Tailwind Typography were not optimized for the project's dark blue background and overall design.
   - Text colors lacked sufficient contrast.
   - Blockquotes and inline code were difficult to read.
   - Preformatted text (`<pre>` and `<code>`) did not align with the dark theme.

2. **Custom Design Requirements**: The project required a more polished and visually appealing design for KB articles, including:
   - Better image styling (e.g., responsiveness, rounded corners, shadows).
   - Enhanced blockquote visibility and interactivity.
   - Improved list and heading hierarchy.

3. **Content Compatibility**: KB articles copied from external sources (e.g., Hudu) needed consistent formatting and readability.

**Why This Works:**
- The overrides ensure that the `.prose` class styles are tailored to the project's design and usability needs.
- Adjustments include:
  - Text colors optimized for contrast against the dark blue background.
  - Enhanced styling for images, blockquotes, lists, headings, and code blocks.
  - Compatibility with KB articles copied from external sources.

**What to Watch Out For:**
1. **Conflicts with Custom Styles**: Ensure that other global styles (e.g., `globals.css`) do not unintentionally override `.prose` styles.
2. **Future Content Types**: If `.prose` is applied to other pages or components, verify that the overrides work well in those contexts.
3. **Typography Plugin Updates**: Tailwind Typography plugin updates may introduce changes that conflict with the overrides.
4. **Accessibility**: Regularly test for accessibility issues, such as insufficient text contrast or unreadable elements.

By maintaining these overrides and monitoring their application, the `.prose` class can effectively support the project's design and content goals.

## General Principles
- Prioritize clarity, accessibility, and a modern, professional look.
- Consistency across all pages and components.
- Responsive design: mobile-first, scales up to large screens.

## Layout & Spacing
- Use `max-w-6xl` for main content containers for a spacious, modern feel.
- Center content with `mx-auto` and use `px-6` or greater for horizontal padding.
- Use `py-12` or more for vertical breathing room.
- Use grid or flex layouts for cards and lists.

## Typography
- Use the `prose` class for rich text content.
- Headings: `text-4xl font-bold` for main titles, scale down for subheadings.
- Use `text-gray-900` for primary text, `text-gray-500/700` for secondary.
- Limit line length to 60â€“80 characters for readability.

## Color & Theming
- Use Tailwind's color palette, favoring blue and purple gradients for highlights.
- Support dark mode with `dark:` classes.
- Use semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-white/80`, `dark:bg-gray-900/80`) for glassmorphism.

## Components
- **Cards:**
  - `rounded-2xl shadow-2xl border border-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-500`
  - Hover: `hover:scale-[1.015] hover:shadow-[0_8px_32px_0_rgba(31,38,135,0.37)] hover:border-blue-500`
- **Headings:**
  - Gradient on hover: `hover:text-transparent hover:bg-clip-text hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-blue-500 hover:to-purple-500`
- **Tags/Badges:**
  - `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 text-xs font-semibold px-2 py-1 rounded`
  - Hover: `hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-blue-400 hover:to-purple-400 hover:text-white hover:scale-110`

## Animation & Interactivity
- Use `transition-all duration-500` for cards and containers.
- Use `transition-colors duration-300` for text and icons.
- Animate icons with `hover:scale-110`.
- Only animate properties that change on interaction.

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.).
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible.
- Use `aria-` attributes where appropriate.

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for Astro/JS/TS).
- Prefer functional, composable components.
- Use descriptive variable and prop names.
- Keep logic and presentation separated.
