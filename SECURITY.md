# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes    |
| Older   | ❌ No     |

Only the latest version gets attention. If you're on an older release, please update — that's your best shot at getting any fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, first of all: thanks.

That said, this is a small project with limited time and resources. Complex or niche vulnerabilities might not get fixed right away (or at all). But simple, clearly explained reports are appreciated — especially if they include a suggested fix or patch.

To report something:

- Open an issue and mark it with the `security` label  
- Or email: [vendor@backupfailed.com](mailto:vendor@backupfailed.com)

Please **don’t** submit vague reports like “your app is insecure” without any detail. Be kind. Be helpful.
