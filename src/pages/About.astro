            <p class="mb-4">Tech should be inclusive, not exclusive.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I’ve worked across hospitals, nonprofits, and MSPs. The pattern was the same: good people blocked by jargon, cost, and bloated tools. Backup
                Failed Foundation exists to remove those blockers, so mission-driven teams can focus on their work, not their IT.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I didn’t want to just point at the problem. I wanted to build something that helps solve it. That’s why I started Backup Failed Foundation.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-8">
                We’re not trying to be heroes. We’re building a place where nonprofits, community groups, and small teams get clear answers, working systems,
                and a partner who speaks human.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How We're Funded</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Our core services remain free for qualifying nonprofits. To keep the mission sustainable we offer enterprise-grade MSP services to businesses at
                fair, transparent rates — and a portion of that revenue directly funds free technical support for nonprofits.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                That means when businesses purchase managed IT from us they also create social impact — reliable IT for you, and support for organizations that
                need it most.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-8">We’re all about transparency and sustainability. We’ll always be clear about where funds go and why.</p>

                <br />
                <br />
                We exist to level the playing field by making tech tools, skills, and support available to all who serve their communities. Technology should empower,
                not exclude; our purpose is to break down barriers in the tech world by offering accessible resources, IT Support, education, and peer-led support
                to nonprofits and mission-driven groups—so they can focus on what matters most: serving others.
