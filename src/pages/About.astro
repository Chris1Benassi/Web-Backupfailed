        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why We're Here</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Tech should be inclusive, not exclusive.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            I’ve spent years working in IT; hospitals, nonprofits, MSPs and one thing kept standing out: tech is often built in a way that leaves people out.
            Not because they’re incapable, but because there are too many barriers: jargon, cost, bloated products, or just straight-up complexity.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            I didn’t want to just point at the problem. I wanted to build something that helps solve it. That’s why I started Backup Failed Foundation.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
            This isn’t about being a hero. It’s about creating a space where nonprofits, community groups, and mission-driven teams can get real support and
            grow confidently. They might not want to become cloud architects or sysadmins and that’s totally fine. It is their vision of a better world that
            matters, and we at Backup Failed Foundation are here to help eliminate barriers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How We're Funded</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We believe nonprofits and community orgs shouldn’t have to stress about tech costs. That’s why our core services are <strong>completely free</strong
            > for qualifying nonprofits.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            To keep the lights on, we charge fair rates to businesses and for-profit groups who want to work with us. That revenue helps fund the free tools,
            resources, and hands-on help we provide to mission-driven teams.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">We’re all about transparency and sustainability — and we’ll always be clear about where funds go and why.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Legal Purpose</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">
            This corporation is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the
            Internal Revenue Code.
            <br />
            <br />
            We exist to level the playing field by making tech tools, skills, and support available to all who serve their communities. Technology should empower,
            not exclude; our purpose is to break down barriers in the tech world by offering accessible resources, IT Support, education, and peer-led support to
            nonprofits and mission-driven groups—so they can focus on what matters most: serving others.
