                                        Technology can collect endless alerts, but it takes people to separate noise from what matters. Our Security Operations
                                        Center is staffed day and night by real analysts who review activity and begin response the moment something needs
                                        attention. That means if an incident happens outside of business hours, it’s already being handled. That human element
                                        staffed 24/7 is exactly what insurers look for when deciding rates and paying claims.

                                        Cyber insurance and compliance frameworks often require detailed IT logs without them audits drag on and claims can even
                                        be denied. Our Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system pulls activity from your firewalls, servers, and
                                        cloud apps into one place. That way, when an insurer or auditor asks tough questions, you already have the records. By
                                        bringing all these logs together, we can spot patterns and connections that would be invisible if each system was viewed
                                        on its own.
