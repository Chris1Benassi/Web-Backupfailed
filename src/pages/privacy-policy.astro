                    We use cookies, beacons, SDKs, and similar technologies across our website and client portals to support essential functionality, security,
                    performance monitoring, diagnostics, and analytics. These tools help us operate, protect, and improve our online services, and may include
                    providers such as New Relic and other analytics platforms that collect technical and usage data beyond strictly necessary cookies.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    These technologies may collect information such as your IP address, general location derived from IP, device and browser identifiers,
                    operating system and version, referring and destination URLs, timestamps, session identifiers, and performance metrics (for example, page
                    load times, resource timings, and Core Web Vitals). They may also capture JavaScript error details, API request metadata, and aggregated
                    click or navigation events. If you are signed in to an authenticated area, certain telemetry may be linked to your account to support
                    troubleshooting and ensure account security.

                    You can manage or block cookies through your browser settings and, where available, through our on-site cookie controls. Blocking some
                    cookies may affect website functionality or login persistence. If we introduce third-party advertising or retargeting in the future, we will
                    present appropriate consent options and “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” controls in compliance with applicable privacy laws.
                    We use analytics and performance tools solely to understand reliability and user experience; we do not authorize analytics providers to use
                    our telemetry data for their own advertising or profiling purposes.

                    and processed in, the United States under U.S. law. We may, at our discretion, respond to non-U.S. data subject requests as a courtesy; however, 
                    we do not represent or commit to full GDPR or UK GDPR compliance unless expressly stated in a separately executed Data Processing Agreement.

                    We reserve the right to decline or discontinue service where providing access would subject Backup Failed Foundation to non-U.S. legal obligations that we have not 
                    affirmatively agreed to assume.

                    We do not sell personal information, and we do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising or other targeted marketing purposes.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We disclose personal information only in limited circumstances and with appropriate safeguards. 
                    Disclosures may occur to trusted service providers under written agreement—such as those supporting our telecommunications, hosting, ticketing, 
                    email or SMS delivery, and payment processing functions—who are permitted to use the information solely to perform services on our behalf.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We may also share information with vendors or partners that you explicitly authorize us to coordinate with during service delivery. 
                    In addition, we may disclose information when required by law, regulation, or legal process; in response to lawful requests by public authorities; 
                    or when necessary to protect our rights, property, personnel, or the safety and security of our users or the public.

                <p>
                    In the event of a business transaction such as a merger, reorganization, or other transfer involving Backup Failed Foundation, 
                    personal information may be included among the transferred assets, subject to the protections and limitations described in this Notice.

                <h2 id="data-security" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized 
                    access, use, loss, or disclosure. Our systems and core services are hosted primarily in Microsoft Azure and other reputable cloud environments 
                    that provide built-in encryption, access control, and compliance protections.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Access to systems and data is restricted according to the principle of least privilege. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced wherever supported, 
                    and conditional access policies are used to limit sign-ins based on device health, location, and role. Administrative activities are logged and monitored 
                    through Azure and third-party observability tools to help detect unauthorized behavior and maintain system integrity.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We apply encryption in transit and at rest, follow secure credential management practices, and regularly review vendor security documentation for the 
                    service providers that support our operations—including Dropsuite, Zoho, Level.io, Hudu, Wave, New Relic, AWS, Twilio, and Resend. Vendors are expected to 
                    handle data only as instructed and to implement reasonable safeguards consistent with industry standards.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We maintain an internal incident response plan to guide detection, containment, investigation, and communication in the event of a suspected or confirmed 
                    security incident. Should we determine that unauthorized access to personal information within our control has occurred, we will notify affected individuals 
                    and entities as required by applicable law and take steps to mitigate potential harm.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Information is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Notice or as required by applicable law, regulation, or 
                    contractual obligation. When information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it in accordance with our data retention and disposal practices.

                    artificial-intelligence (“AI”) technologies to support the operation, security, and efficiency of our Services. Such tools may be developed internally
                    or provided by trusted third-party vendors and may include data analysis, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, or pattern recognition systems
                    designed to enhance service reliability and incident response.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We do <strong>not</strong> engage in fully automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects on individuals without human
                    oversight. Any AI-assisted processes we employ are used to augment human review and decision-making, not to replace it. All final decisions involving
                    clients, partners, or individuals are subject to human validation and accountability.
                </p>

                <p>

                    including least-privilege access, encryption, and vendor due diligence. We evaluate AI and algorithmic tools prior to deployment to ensure that they
                    align with our mission, applicable law, and internal governance standards. Where feasible, we assess the quality, relevance, and fairness of data used
                    to train or operate such systems and take reasonable measures to mitigate bias or unintended discriminatory outcomes.

                <p>
                    To the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request information regarding the existence of automated decision-making involving
                    your personal information, to obtain meaningful information about the logic involved, and to request human review of decisions made solely by automated
                    means, if any. Such requests can be made by contacting us at

                    legally consequential determinations. If, in the future, Backup Failed materially changes the nature or scope of its AI or automated processing
                    practices, we will update this Notice and, where required by law, provide additional disclosure or obtain consent prior to such use.

                    For the avoidance of doubt, references to “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” or “automated processing” in this Notice include any
                    computational or statistical systems capable of generating predictions, classifications, or other analytical outputs based on data patterns, whether
                    or not such systems employ adaptive learning models. This provision is intended to satisfy disclosure requirements under U.S. state privacy laws
                    (including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the CPRA, and similar state frameworks) and to demonstrate adherence to general

                <p>
                    We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to deliver Services, maintain security and operational integrity, 
                    comply with legal or accounting obligations, and resolve disputes or enforce agreements. 
                    Retention periods vary depending on the type of information and the purpose for which it was collected.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    For example, client and account records are typically retained for the duration of the relationship plus a reasonable period afterward, 
                    and financial and donor records are maintained for at least seven years to comply with IRS and accounting requirements. 
                    Support tickets, configuration data, and service documentation may be kept for a limited time following offboarding 
                    to preserve context for follow-up or audit purposes. Website and diagnostic logs are retained only for short operational windows.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Backups are maintained on a rolling twelve-month schedule and securely deleted as new backups replace older ones. 
                    Communication archives, including email and SMS messages, are preserved as part of our business records for reference and accountability. 
                    When information is no longer needed, we delete it from active systems using secure methods consistent with industry standards and applicable law.

                <p>
                    We may enable optional sign-in through trusted identity providers such as Microsoft Entra ID, Google, or Facebook to simplify authentication for future
                    client portals or integrated services. When you choose to sign in using one of these providers, we receive only the basic information that provider
                    shares with us—typically your name, email address, and profile image—and use it solely to authenticate access or provide support.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We do not store social login credentials or reuse tokens beyond what is required for secure session management. Your interactions with the external
                    identity provider remain subject to that provider’s privacy policy and account settings. Using a federated or social login is entirely optional and does
                    not grant us access to your broader account activity with those platforms.

                <p>
                    Consistent with applicable state laws, we also do not knowingly sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising involving
                    minors under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly permit minors to register for or use our Services in any way that would require submission of personal
                    information beyond limited, business-related contact details provided by adults.

                <h2 id="do-not-track" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">16. Do Not Track &amp; Global Privacy Signals</h2>
                <p>
                    Some browsers and extensions allow users to send a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar signal to websites. At this time, no uniform technical
                    standard has been adopted to govern how organizations should respond to such signals, and most websites—including ours—do not currently
                    take action in response to them. Accordingly, we do not interpret or respond to DNT signals.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We recognize, however, that certain privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the CPRA), refer to
                    “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) signals or equivalent browser-based preferences. If and when legally recognized technical standards
                    for honoring GPC or comparable mechanisms are finalized, Backup Failed Foundation will assess and implement appropriate updates to
                    its systems and this Notice to ensure compliance.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Regardless of browser signals, you may exercise available privacy and opt-out choices directly through the methods described in the
                    <a href="#your-choices" class="underline">Your Choices &amp; Controls</a> and
                    <a href="#us-state-rights" class="underline">U.S. State Privacy Rights</a> sections of this Notice.

                <h2 id="data-requests" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">17. Data Requests and Verification Process</h2>

                <p>
                    Individuals may exercise applicable privacy rights by submitting a request to 
                    <a href="mailto:support@backupfailed.com">support@backupfailed.com</a> with “Privacy Request” in the subject line or through our website’s contact form. 
                    Depending on your location and the nature of your relationship with Backup Failed Foundation, these rights may include access, correction, deletion, or 
                    receipt of a copy of your personal information, as well as the right to opt out of certain processing or disclosures.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We verify the identity of each requestor before processing a request. Verification typically involves confirming that the request originates from the same 
                    email address or contact information already associated with our records, or requesting additional information sufficient to reasonably confirm identity. 
                    Authorized agents may submit requests on behalf of another individual if they provide documentation demonstrating valid authorization and, where required, 
                    the individual’s own verification of identity.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We respond to verified requests within the period required by applicable law—generally within forty-five (45) days—and will notify you if additional time 
                    is needed to complete the request. Certain information may be exempt from deletion or disclosure where retention is necessary to comply with legal, security, 
                    or contractual obligations. If we decline a request, we will explain the reason, and you may contact us to seek further review or clarification.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Backup Failed Foundation does not discriminate against individuals for exercising privacy rights and will not deny services, charge different rates, or 
                    provide a different level of service solely because a privacy right has been exercised.
                </p>

                    our Services. When we make updates, we will revise the “Last Updated” date shown at the top of this Notice. All revisions become effective immediately

                    reasonably appropriate—such as by email, site banner, or in-portal message—so that affected individuals are informed before the change takes effect. 
                    We encourage you to review this Notice periodically to remain aware of how we protect your information.
                </p>
