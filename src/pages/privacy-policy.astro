                <p>
                    This Notice covers personal information we process as a controller for our website and client-facing services. It does not cover third-party
                    sites or services we link to; those have their own privacy terms.
                </p>

                <h2 id="what-we-collect" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. What We Collect (Categories)</h2>
                <p>We collect the following categories of information, depending on your interactions with us:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Identifiers and contact details:</strong> name, email, phone number, mailing address, organization, role/title.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Communications &amp; support artifacts:</strong> tickets, emails, call/SMS logs, attachments, configuration notes, change histories.

                </ul>

                <p>
                    We do not intentionally seek sensitive characteristics (e.g., race, health). We may process account credentials or similar “sensitive
                    personal information” only to provide managed IT services you request, with access restricted by least privilege.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Payment processing:</strong> Card payments are handled by Wave. See Wave’s privacy policy for their handling practices. We receive confirmation
                    and limited metadata, not full card details.

                    service-related communications (including SMS alerts), updates, and notices about changes to terms or service status; troubleshoot; prevent
                    fraud/abuse; enforce our terms and policies; meet legal and audit obligations; improve documentation, processes, and site usability; and
                    send marketing communications only if you opt in (you can opt out anytime).
                </p>

                <h2 id="sms-privacy" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. SMS Program Privacy (Twilio/A2P)</h2>
                <p>
                    If you provide a mobile number and opt in, we send SMS related to your services (alerts, account/security updates, support). Message
                    frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to unsubscribe and HELP for help. Carriers are not liable for delayed or
                    undelivered messages. We do not sell or share mobile numbers for third-party marketing. SMS availability and delivery may vary outside the
                    U.S. See also our Terms of Service – SMS Messaging Terms.
                </p>

                <h2 id="text-messaging-sms" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Text Messaging (SMS)</h2>
                <p>
                    If you provide your phone number and consent, we may send you service‑related text messages (e.g., acknowledging your request or
                    coordinating support). We do not send marketing texts. Message and data rates may apply. You can opt out at any time by replying STOP. We
                    only use your phone number to support your request and do not sell your personal information. We retain SMS‑related data as needed to
                    provide service and meet legal obligations. See “Your Choices” for opt‑out details and “Data Retention” for how long we keep information.
                </p>

                <h2 id="cookies-telemetry" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Cookies, Telemetry, and Online Tracking</h2>
                <p>
                    We use cookies, beacons, SDKs, and similar technologies on our website and client portals for security, functionality, performance
                    monitoring, diagnostics, and analytics. This includes tools such as New Relic (and may include other analytics providers) that collect
                    technical and usage data beyond strictly necessary cookies to help us operate, secure, and improve the site and troubleshoot issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These technologies may capture information such as your IP address, general location derived from IP, device and browser identifiers,
                    operating system and version, page URLs and referrers, timestamps, session identifiers, page load and performance metrics (e.g.,
                    request/response timing, Core Web Vitals, resource timings), JavaScript error details and stack traces, API request metadata, click and
                    navigation events in aggregate, and similar diagnostic signals. If you are signed into an authenticated area, some telemetry can be
                    associated with your account to support troubleshooting and security.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can control cookies through your browser settings and, where offered, through our on-site controls. Blocking cookies may affect some
                    features. If we enable third-party advertising or retargeting in the future, we will present appropriate consent and “Do Not Sell or Share
                    My Personal Information” options as required by law. We use performance and analytics tools to understand reliability and usage; we do not
                    permit those providers to use our site telemetry for their own advertising to you.
                </p>

                <h2 id="international-users" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. International Users and Data Location</h2>
                <p>
                    We are a U.S. organization and our Services are directed primarily to organizations and users in the United States. Our systems and service
                    providers are predominantly located in the U.S., and your information will be processed in the U.S., where privacy laws may differ from
                    those of your home jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We do not position our Services as subject to EU/EEA or UK data protection regimes (GDPR/UK GDPR). If you are outside the U.S. and choose to
                    use the Services, you do so understanding that your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, and you consent
                    to that transfer and processing under U.S. law. We may, at our discretion, respond to non-U.S. data subject requests as a courtesy, but we
                    do not commit to GDPR/UK GDPR compliance unless we have expressly agreed to do so in a separate, signed data processing agreement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If applicable law where you are located imposes specific requirements on your use of our Services, you are responsible for ensuring that
                    your use is lawful in your jurisdiction. We may decline to provide Services where doing so would subject us to non-U.S. legal obligations we
                    have not agreed to assume.
                </p>

                <h2 id="how-we-share" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. How We Share Information</h2>
                <p>We do not sell personal information and we do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>

                <p>
                    We disclose personal information only to: service providers under contract (e.g., telecom, hosting, ticketing, email/SMS delivery, payment
                    processing) who must use it solely to provide services to us; client-authorized vendors when you ask us to coordinate with them;
                    legal/compliance recipients when required by law, to respond to lawful requests, or to protect rights, safety, or security; and in business
                    transfers (e.g., merger or reorganization) where information is part of the transferred assets, subject to this Notice.
                </p>

                <h2 id="data-security" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We apply administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate for an MSP: least-privilege access, credential management,
                    encryption in transit, and vendor due diligence. No system is perfectly secure. If we confirm unauthorized access to personal information
                    within our control, we will notify as required by law and cooperate to mitigate harm.
                </p>

                <h2 id="data-retention" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We keep personal information only as long as needed to deliver Services, for security and operations, to comply with legal/accounting
                    requirements, and to resolve disputes. Examples: account records for the account’s life plus a reasonable period, ticket histories and
                    configuration artifacts for a limited period after offboarding, website logs for a short operational window, and SMS metadata for a limited
                    period consistent with carrier and operational needs. Backups are deleted on a rolling schedule. When information is no longer needed, we
                    delete or de-identify it.
                </p>
