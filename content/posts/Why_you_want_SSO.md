# What are Centralized Logins and why You Should Have It


<br />
<br />



As your business grows, so does the number of tools your team uses. Think about every application you log in, then multiply that by total number of employees. Each one of those is a target. Zoom, email, Slack, in-house apps… before you know it, each employee has over 10 different logins.
This creates real problems like users forgetting their passwords, admins spending time resetting them, and the biggest security concern is delays in onboarding or offboarding.
<br />
<br />
Enter **centralized logins**, also known as **Single Sign-On (SSO).**

With a system like **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD), users log in once to their Microsoft account. Once authenticated they get access to everything they need: Zoom, Salesforce, Google Workspace, in-house systems, and more. If it’s integrated with Entra, it just works. This reduces password fatigue, which usually leads to end users reusing the same password. It improves user management for onboarding or offboarding. Allows you to apply security policies across all services using conditional access policies. There are other benefits as well but those are some significant ones I can think of, at the time of this writing.
<br />

## Do You Need Microsoft Business Premium?
<br />
<br />

Not necessarily. SSO with third-party cloud apps is available on most Microsoft 365 plans. However, **Business Premium** includes advanced features like conditional access, device compliance, seamless SSO, and Microsoft Defender for Business. If you're serious about automation, security, and managing endpoints, Business Premium is worth it.

## What Is Seamless SSO?
<br />

Seamless Single Sign-On lets users on trusted devices access apps without typing a password at all. It's a frictionless experience—ideal for hybrid and domain-joined environments.
