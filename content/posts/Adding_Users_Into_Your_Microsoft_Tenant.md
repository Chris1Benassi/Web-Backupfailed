## Overview

This will show you how to add a user into your Microsoft tenant account. There are many ways of doing this, like Entra Admin Portal, Azure Admin Portal, and Office Admin Portal. We will be doing it through the Office Admin Portal.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Administrator Role to add users.

## Warnings

> ⚠️ Adding a user will require a license unless they are replacing someone.  
> ⚠️ Do not give the password to the end user via unencrypted email.

## Steps

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.cloud.microsoft).
2. Go to **Users > Active users**, and select **Add a user**.
3. In the **Set up the basics** pane, fill in the basic user information, and then select **Next**.
   - **Name:** Fill in the first and last name, display name, and username.
   - **Domains:** Choose the domain for the user's account. For example, if the user's username is Jakob, and the domain is contoso.com, they'll sign in by using jakob@contoso.com.
   - **Password settings:** Choose to use the autogenerated password or to create your own strong password for the user.
   - The user must change their password after 90 days. Or you can choose to require this user to change their password when they first sign in.
4. In the **Assign product licenses** pane, select the location and the appropriate license for the user. If you don't have any licenses available, you can still add a user and buy additional licenses. Expand **Apps** and select or deselect apps to limit the apps the user has a license for. Select **Next**.
5. In the **Optional settings** pane, expand **Roles** if you want to make this user an admin. Expand **Profile info** to add additional information about the user. Select **Next**.
6. In the **Review and finish** page, review your new user's settings, make any changes you like, then select **Finish adding**.
7. On the ...added to active users page:
   - To get the user their password, select **Print** to create a hard copy or a PDF of their credentials that you can securely share with them.
   - Send them an email that contains useful information to help them get started with Microsoft 365.
   - Select whether you want to save these user settings as a template and choose whether you want to add another user.
   - Select **Close**.
