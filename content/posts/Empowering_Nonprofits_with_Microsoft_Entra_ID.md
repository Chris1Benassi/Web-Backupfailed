# Empowering your nonprofit organization with Microsoft Entra ID

<br />
<br />

If you caught our last post on why unique logins matter, you know Backup Failed Foundation (BFF) is committed to helping nonprofits secure their staff identities. So, what does Microsoft Entra ID cost your organization today? Here’s the straightforward breakdown:<p>

**Microsoft 365 Business Premium for Nonprofits**  
For $5.50/user/month (nonprofit rate), each team member gets a full suite: Entra ID Plan 1, Intune device management, Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, Office apps, and more. This covers both identity protection and collaboration tools—ideal for staff who need email, file sharing, and secure access.

<br /><br />
**Need Only Identity Management?**  
>If you just need secure logins and identity features (without Office apps), Entra ID Plan 1 is available as a standalone option at $3/user/month.

<br /><br />
**Scaling Up**  
You can mix and match up to 300 Business Premium seats. For larger organizations, Microsoft 365 Enterprise (E3/E5) plans are available—reach out and we’ll help you choose the right fit for your budget and security needs.<br /><br />

> **Update as of May 2025:** Microsoft has announced the discontinuation of the 10 free Business Premium licenses for nonprofits. Discounted rates remain, so while the entry cost is a bit higher, a secure, modern environment is still within reach for most organizations.<br /><br />



## Device Requirements: Windows Pro or Enterprise

<br /><br />To actually “join” your staff’s PCs to Entra ID, they need Windows 10/11 Pro (or Enterprise). If any machines are running Windows Home in your office, plan a one-time upgrade (around $100 per device retail, but charity or volume discounts often apply). Upgrading unlocks BitLocker, group policy enforcement, and that seamless corporate sign-in experience. 


<br />Why Backup Failed Foundation?  
Sure, you can shop around and we’ll encourage you to compare. But if you’re a small nonprofit that’s been priced out of enterprise tooling, we’re the team that steps in when others say “sorry, that’s too small.” From paperwork and tenant configuration to conditional access design and Autopilot deployments, we’ll handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on your mission.

Bottom line:  
You can stand up a full blown identity platform—with SSO, MFA, password self-service, device management and more for zero dollars on your first ten seats. After that, it’s just a few bucks per user each month, plus a one-time Pro upgrade if you need it. Ready to lock down your logins?
