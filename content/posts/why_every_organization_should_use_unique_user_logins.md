## Overview

This guide explains why unique user logins are essential for every organization and provides actionable steps to implement them. Unique logins are critical for accountability, compliance, and protecting your business from costly mistakes or malicious actions.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your organization's IT systems (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, etc.)
- A list of all users and devices
- Willingness to update policies and train staff

## Warnings & Gotchas

> ⚠️ Shared logins violate most compliance frameworks (PCI, HIPAA, SOX, FINRA, GDPR) and can result in fines, failed audits, or data breaches.
> ⚠️ Migrating from shared to unique logins may require downtime and user retraining. Plan accordingly.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current Accounts and Access**
   - List all shared accounts and where they are used (computers, apps, cloud services).
   - Identify which users need access to which resources.

2. **Create Unique Accounts for Each User**
   - In your identity provider (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace), create a separate account for every employee, contractor, and admin.
   - Use strong, unique usernames (e.g., first.last@yourdomain.com).

3. **Assign Appropriate Permissions**
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only have access to what they need.
   - Remove excessive admin rights and shared passwords.

4. **Migrate Data and Settings**
   - Move files, bookmarks, and settings from shared accounts to individual user accounts.
   - Communicate the migration plan and timeline to all staff.

5. **Enforce Strong Authentication**
   - Require strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts.

6. **Monitor and Audit Regularly**
   - Use your identity provider’s audit logs to track account activity and detect suspicious behavior.
   - Schedule regular reviews of user access and permissions.
   - Train users on the importance of unique logins and how to use their new accounts.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- If you use Microsoft 365, see [How To - Microsoft 365 - Creating New Users For Organization](./Adding_Users_Into_Your_Microsoft_Tenant.md) for step-by-step instructions.
- For Google Workspace, follow [Google’s guide to adding users](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33310?hl=en).
- If users resist the change, emphasize compliance, security, and the ability to track and recover from mistakes.
