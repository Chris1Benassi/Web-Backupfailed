# Why Every Organization Should Use Unique User Logins

In today’s fast-paced world, many startups, nonprofits, and small offices end up having all employees share a single computer login. Sure, there are “conveniences”—no folder-sharing headaches, easy bookmarks, and the power for one employee to wipe the whole machine without a trace. My last point may sound harsh, but let’s dig into why unique user accounts aren’t just nice to have—they’re critical for any organization serious about security and compliance.

## Accountability and Compliance

Let’s imagine a scenario all too common if you ask me. A business called *“Ice Cream for All”*, where Bob, Alice, and Carol all use the same “staff” account. You come into the office on Friday getting ready to do payroll, but all the files appear to be deleted. It was likely not done intentionally but accidentally—let’s give the employees the benefit of the doubt for a moment. We have no way of knowing who caused such action.  

Unique logins ensure every action—from installing software, editing documents, to accessing sensitive data—is tied back to a specific individual.

If that is a risk you are willing to accept, I will not try to change your mind. I believe every business owner knows best what an acceptable risk is and what is not.  

Let’s instead look at this from the regulatory and compliance requirements. Most modern compliance frameworks insist on unique user accounts. For example, the **Payment Card Industry (PCI)** mandates that every user has a unique ID before allowing them to access system components or cardholder data. Shared accounts violate this rule, putting you at risk of fines, audits, or even losing your ability to process credit card payments.  

Can your organization not just survive but thrive if you are unable to process credit card transactions? PCI isn’t the only framework that demands unique user logins—**HIPAA, SOX, FINRA, GDPR**, and others do as well. Failing to comply isn’t just an IT issue; it’s a critical business risk that can lead to hefty penalties and reputational damage.

## Features and Advantages

So far, I’ve been talking about how the lack of unique logins means bad news, but there are some advantages to having unique logins:  

- **Granular Access Controls**: What if, on Payroll Day, instead of everything being wiped, it’s just Bob’s files missing because he accidentally deleted the Documents folder? Unique logins ensure each user only has access to the necessary files and nothing more.  

How does one even start on this journey? At **Backup Failed Foundation**, we implement **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** to guarantee every employee, including contractors, has their own secure, cloud-backed login.  

By integrating Entra ID, you not only enforce unique logins but also open the possibilities for scalability, reliability, and advanced security features available on Microsoft’s platform. With **role-based groups** in Entra ID, you can quickly share resources like files, apps, or printers—all without compromising operational security.  

In addition, if your compliance officer needs a user access report or an external auditor wants proof of controls, you can generate everything on demand.
